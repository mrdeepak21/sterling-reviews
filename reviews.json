Their \"check writing function is not working\"  My husband is 92. Their representative said today she has thousands of emails. If thousands of dollars are being withheld from thousands over 90 consider the interest and the odds that much of it will be overlooked or forgotten. Sounds like a business strategy to us.",

Unfortunately we did lose our ability to write checks for several months due to an issue at our mailing vendor, but we could always ACH the money to you and ACH payments are delivered within several days. I see that the ACH payment was presented to your husband but he declined that option and decided to wait for the checks to be available, which were sent out in early May. I know it was a very stressful time for all and I hope moving forward we can prove to you through our service that requests for disbursement are completed in a timely manner. Please reach out to us at 800.617.4729 if you have any further questions or concerns.\n",

      "comment": "Terrible HSA administration company. In December of 2023 they failed to disperse requested funds for 18 days.\nStaff and administration are incompetent. I\u0027m on 21 days and count to fund my 2024 maximum contribution base on inaccurate and incomplete instructions. 21 emails later they received the funds on Thursday and on Friday they told me they were hoping to show the deposit on Monday or Tuesday.\nIf you have a choice on another HSA administration company run from Sterling. They are getting rich on fees and inappropriately hold your funds at your expense.",

I was immediately locked out of my account and spent months trying to regain access with little to no help from the \"customer service\" team. Ultimately, they were unable to help me regain access and as the end of the 90 days was approaching asked me to hand write submission forms. I did this, I submitted the receipts, and I asked if the documentation was sufficient and anything else needed. I asked multiple times over the course of two weeks. The response finally came that my documentation was sufficient and a check was being sent. Now, after the 90 days have passed - a time frame they were well aware of, they are coming back and saying the documentation is no longer sufficient and I can go through a long process to appeal their decision. The information provided on how I would know what was required and why the claim was denied was on the account they would not help me gain access to.",

I’m having a hard time trying to to get a reimbursement back from Sterling, I went to the urgent care on 12/22/23 and after the service I went to swipe my Sterling card and it declined and tried several times and declined every time, there was a line and I had to pay via my debit card. I submitted countless Claims and they all getting denied due to “insufficient Documentation”, I call them and waited to talk to someone and told me about 1hr 45mins and I told them my situation and they said it was insufficient documentation, and I submitted new claims with new documents and keep getting declined and have to call them again to see what’s going on! Every time I call them they give me a different excuse to why it’s getting declined, Like: The documentation is not clear and not visible! How?… it’s a PDF documentation. I call them again and they said ohh the documentation doesn’t have your name in it, I submitted a new claim another excuse, we can’t see which debit card you paid with, submitted my receipt from previous claims , and another excuse it doesn’t show the amount you paid. So every time I call they give me an excuse after excuse and they tell me what they need and I put it on the claims and still getting declined. ALL THEY DO IS GIVE EXUCSE! Why pay when guys cant even resolve a $50 claim. Our Company pays for your services and you guys don’t even do nothing. Worst Service \u0026 Company Overall! Don’t even bother to contract this company.",

I actually cancelled or early term ended my Healthcare, now I don\u0027t have any, They wouldn\u0027t take my money, Month after Month I would set up a recurring payment, they would wait two months then send a threatening letter saying that my Healthcare had been suspended. I got tired of it. This time they did the same thing only told me that it could not be reactivated I quote \"Hello xxxxxx, we regret for the inconvenience, but we are bound by the laws and regulations that govern the administration of your former employer\u0027s group benefit plan.\"\n\nThey wouldn\u0027t take the money. I couldn\u0027t log in to the site as it said user name and password were incorrect but no one would get back to me until I wrote a real threatening email and surprise it worked again without any changes.\n\nEven when I signed up it was 3 months before my Cobra through Bluesheild was activated, in the end I had to call Bluesheild and they got it going. No-one would respond to my calls or my emails.\n\nThey won\u0027t return calls in any kind of timely manner, if they do respond they\u0027ll leave a voice mail so you have no written record, email responses take a week or so, sometimes two. I suspect they were hired as the Administrator of Cobra so I would quit using it and my former employer could walk away from their liabilities, there\u0027s some sort of scam going on.\n\nRead their Yelp and Google and BBB reviews, they have one star on almost every single one,  they\u0027ve failed to make payments for people that are suffering from Cancer and other diseases. They have a flood of employee reviews, all around 3 stars and I suspect someone clever published those to drown out or deflect from the massive amount of poor customer 1 star reviews.",

The ad says they will refund you up to one year monthly fee if you’re not satisfied with their service. Sure I’m not happy. But it’s a scam. It only shows up in Google search result. The official website hides this false statement. Called for hours. Service people was not helpful at all, denying they have this refund policy, showed contempt to my right in all sort of ways in a passive aggressive manner. I later tried to transfer my HSA out of Sterling to Fidelity for the latter charges no monthly fee. But it takes forever to get the transaction completed. I don’t even find a way to complain. It’s still in pending.",

Transferring money which you must first deposit with Sterling to invest with their partner, TDA, takes a ridiculous amount of time. Their website is very poorly designed.... your account links are on the left margin, blank space to the right....click a link, and you don\u0027t see that your info has loaded far down on the page. EVERY year-end (December), there is an issue with incorrect information on the site about next year\u0027s contribution limits and the application appears to allow scheduling a contribution in December for a January contribution, but in fact fails. Every year I ask to have this escalated to the Tech Dept, and every year the problem persists. After yet another change to terms (they now require I keep an extra $500 idle in the base account and cannot transfer / invest it at TDA, so they earn money on my money, while I lose out), I am trying to transfer to a new HSA administrator and shut this mess down. NO progress in over two weeks and multiple calls, letters, emails from me, TDA,or Fidelity (new HSA administrator); I now discovered multiple Service reps gave me explicitly wrong info. Promises for a call back result in no call. They don\u0027t tell you upfront, but they have no process or will not do an institution-to-institution transfer if you want to move your HSA to another administrator. Apparently, they\u0027ll take your money but make it very difficult to get it back. I would NEVER recommend Sterling!",
